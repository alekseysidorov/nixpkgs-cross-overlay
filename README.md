# nixpkgs-cross-overlay

Nix Package Manager has incredible cross-compilation support, but vanilla packages
sometimes have some cross-compilation issues. This overlay contains some improvements
and bugfixes to provide a better experience.

blablabla...

nixpkgs-cross-overlay targets `nixpkgs-unstable` channel, they are tested on CI.
It may also work on other channels but it is not guaranteed.
